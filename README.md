# Easy WRF

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model has many dependencies and is often challenging to install and set up. This package automatically installs all WRF dependencies and generates install scripts and configuration files for WRF.

This package has been tested on the UConn HPC cluster and the Heaviside cluster operating on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Ubuntu 22.  

```bash
conda create -n wrf -c conda-forge easy_wrf
```
